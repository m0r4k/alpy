# Sparks debian (ubuntu) amd64 [ i386 is not tested ]

This is beta stage build for Debian Package. Main goal is creating an easy to install  
package for coins with masternode capability. Configs, sentinel, systemd, boostrap auto install   
scripts are included.  

## signed package  
Because this package is in beta stage it is not signed and not available on a public mirror.  
If you are afraid of installing it you can download the coins installation package and   
compare the checksums  

## FREE to USE  
Because this packages are under the license of OpenGl and the masternode-programms mostly under   
MIT licence you are free to use -> share -> modify. As a so called "one man show" I would  
appreciate to get informed on modifications or forks.  

I'm willing to learn from others! New coins will be supported on requests.  

## Installation  
Check the docs folder  
see documentation [here](docs/INSTALL.md)


## Donation
